# ‚úÖ ngrok Setup Fixed + Your Questions Answered

## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Resolved!

The `setup-ngrok-webhook.sh` script has been improved to:

‚úÖ **Check for existing ngrok** - If already running, it uses the existing tunnel  
‚úÖ **Better error handling** - More detailed logs and retry logic  
‚úÖ **Improved URL detection** - Works with both `.ngrok.io` and `.ngrok-free.dev`  
‚úÖ **Smart cleanup** - Only stops ngrok if it started it

## üìã Your Questions Answered

### Q1: Do we need to run this window continuously for ngrok to work as webhook endpoint locally?

**YES** - ngrok needs to keep running to maintain the tunnel. Here's why:

**ngrok creates a secure tunnel** from the internet to your local machine:

```
Internet ‚Üí ngrok servers ‚Üí your local port 3000
```

**If ngrok stops, the tunnel breaks**, and Stripe can't reach your webhook endpoint.

### Q2: How to manage ngrok properly?

You have several options:

#### Option 1: Use the Fixed Setup Script (Recommended)

```bash
./setup-ngrok-webhook.sh
# This will detect existing ngrok or start new one
# Keep this terminal open
```

#### Option 2: Use the New ngrok Manager

```bash
# Start ngrok
./ngrok-manager.sh start

# Check status
./ngrok-manager.sh status

# Get webhook URL
./ngrok-manager.sh url

# Stop ngrok
./ngrok-manager.sh stop
```

#### Option 3: Manual Management

```bash
# Start ngrok (keep terminal open)
ngrok http 3000

# In another terminal, get URL
curl -s http://localhost:4040/api/tunnels | grep -o 'https://[^"]*\.ngrok[^"]*\.dev'

# Stop ngrok (Ctrl+C in ngrok terminal)
```

## üîÑ Typical Workflow

### Development Session:

1. **Start your app**: `npm run start:dev`
2. **Start ngrok**: `./setup-ngrok-webhook.sh`
3. **Copy webhook URL** to Stripe dashboard
4. **Keep both running** while developing
5. **Stop when done**: Ctrl+C in ngrok terminal

### Multiple Development Sessions:

```bash
# Day 1
./ngrok-manager.sh start
# Copy URL to Stripe: https://abc123.ngrok-free.dev/api/v1/stripe/webhook

# Day 2 (ngrok stopped overnight)
./ngrok-manager.sh start
# New URL: https://xyz789.ngrok-free.dev/api/v1/stripe/webhook
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Must update URL in Stripe dashboard!
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

### Free ngrok Limitations:

- **URL changes** every restart
- **Must update Stripe** webhook URL each time
- **Session timeout** after inactivity

### Solutions:

#### 1. For Frequent Development:

```bash
# Use the manager to quickly get URLs
./ngrok-manager.sh url
# Copy new URL to Stripe when needed
```

#### 2. For Production/Staging:

```bash
# Use your actual domain instead of ngrok
https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/stripe/webhook
```

#### 3. For Persistent ngrok (Paid Plan):

```bash
# Configure custom subdomain (requires paid plan)
ngrok http 3000 --subdomain=your-app-name
# URL stays the same: https://your-app-name.ngrok.io
```

## üöÄ Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Check what's running
./ngrok-manager.sh status

# Get current webhook URL
./ngrok-manager.sh url

# Start if not running
./ngrok-manager.sh start

# Restart ngrok (get new URL)
./ngrok-manager.sh restart

# Stop ngrok
./ngrok-manager.sh stop

# View ngrok dashboard
./ngrok-manager.sh dashboard
# Or open: http://localhost:4040
```

## üìä Monitoring Your Webhooks

### ngrok Dashboard (Recommended):

- **URL**: http://localhost:4040
- **Features**: See all incoming requests, responses, replay requests
- **Perfect for debugging** webhook issues

### Your App Logs:

```bash
# Watch your NestJS logs for webhook processing
npm run start:dev
# Look for: "Received Stripe webhook" messages
```

### Stripe Dashboard:

- **Webhook deliveries**: See success/failure status
- **Retry failed deliveries**: Manual retry option

## üéØ Best Practices

### 1. Development Workflow:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Your app
npm run start:dev

# Terminal 2: ngrok (keep open)
./setup-ngrok-webhook.sh

# Terminal 3: Development commands
git status
npm test
etc.
```

### 2. When ngrok URL Changes:

1. Get new URL: `./ngrok-manager.sh url`
2. Update Stripe webhook endpoint
3. Test webhook delivery
4. Continue development

### 3. Production Deployment:

- **Never use ngrok** in production
- **Use your domain**: `https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/stripe/webhook`
- **Set up proper SSL** certificate
- **Configure firewall** rules
